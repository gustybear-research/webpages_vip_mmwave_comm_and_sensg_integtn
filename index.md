# Project Summary
 As autonomous vehicles revolutionize our transportation ecosystem, Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is a promising technology to meet the data rate demand of V2X (vehicle to everything) networks. This project aims to design an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for V2X network using mmWave MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) to deliver accurate radar sensing and reliable communication in a high-mobility environment.

# Research Issues 
 Design an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for V2X network using mmWave MIMO and deliver accurate radar sensing and reliable communication in a high-mobility environment. Includes three complimentary thrusts: Improve mmWave MIMO Channel Condition with IRS (intelligent reflecting surface), Multi-Target Radar Sensing with CSI (channel state information) and DPS (doppler power spectrum), and reliable Multi-Beam mmWave V2X Network with Predictive IA. 
 ### Equipment
