# Executive Summary
This project aims to design a millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication system with integrated radar sensing capability. As a promising technology, radio communication at mmWave frequencies, particularly between 24 to 32 GHz, can meet the data rate demand of future generations of wireless networks. Unfortunately, the mmWave bands are often used by short-range radar sensors essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles and remote healthcare. Introducing a separate communication system in these bands would strain the spectrum congestion, leading to suboptimal performance for both communication and sensing. To address this issue, Monet aims to unify mmWave radar and communication functions via the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technique augmented by reconfigurable reflective arrays to achieve reliable communication and accurate radar sensing.
